This is a list of things I think need to be done before release.  Add
to it and subtract from it.

I like what we have now, I think we can call this done.

* high priority
** TODO parse .nethackrc

** TODO finish up the cooked status window stuff

** TODO Makefile shouldn't require GNU make

* low priority
** TODO tiles under xemacs

** TODO scrolling the map should happen *before* you step across the edge
   C-l now works, so you can manually recenter

** TODO turning on DEC graphics (for example) breaks things (invalid characters)
   We need to hardcode/override some of the preferences.

** TODO indicate/track the menu state
   we should somehow track when a menu is active, so if the window configuration
   gets mixed up while a menu is active, the user knows this and can easily
   continue working in a menu and not be confused when keystokes in the map
   buffer arent getting any response.

** TODO design a clean way to customize the printing
   (how and where (ie modeline)).

* lower priority
** TODO make RET or SPC toggle menu entries that the point is on
   we have too many potential bindings for these keys.  what exactly
   should the defaults be?

** TODO print a message in the echo area describing how to dismiss a popup

** TODO nethack options should be respected where possible
   in particular the color boolean

** TODO there should be some indication of whether or not a menu
   is pick-one or pick-any or pick-none. This is not shown in any other
   port however.

** TODO the menu that never goes away is actually a dedicated inventory window.
   try to bury it if possible after submitting it, otherwise its always
   the next buffer in the list, so switching away from the map lands you
   there.  at best, erase its contents so its not quite so confusing.
   perhaps it should be a hidden buffer?

** TODO fix byte-compile warnings

* finished, sorta?

** DONE make all the variables customizable through M-x customize
   most of these are done.  do the rest of them.

** DONE window configuration stuff should be customizable and good
   something like what gnus has.  or maybe something else.
