nethack-el installation instructions (roughly) -*- outline -*-

* Installing the nethack binary with the lisp window port

Please note that these instructions are in addition to the
installation instructions that come with the Nethack sources.  Please
read the instructions specific to your system.  These instructions are
known to work on a unix system.

** Download nethack-342.tgz from ftp.nethack.org or your closest mirror.

*** Untar the package and apply the enh-343.patch (found in nethack-el-VERSION.tar.gz)
with the command "patch -p 1 < enh-343.patch"

*** Follow the instructions in nethack/sys/*/Install.* 
This may be as simple as running "sys/unix/setup.sh" to copy the
Makefiles.

The patch automatically configures the nethack source to build the lisp
windowing system.

*** compile (from the toplevel)
make
make install

* Installing the emacs lisp sources
Edit the Makefile to set the value of EMACS to the location of your
favourite emacs version.

** byte compile (not strictly necessary)
make all

** ensure that the *.elc files can be found in your load-path in your load-path
TODO: should we have a make install target?  What IS the Right Way to
install elisp code?

** add to your .emacs:
(autoload 'nethack "nethack" "Play Nethack." t)
(setq nethack-program "/PATH/TO/nethack")

** M-x nethack RET

* Notes

** SlashEM
I have created a patch for SlashEM Version 0.0.7E3. The patch is
called ese-007e3.patch. To play SlashEM inside emacs, do the same as
above, but use the SlashEM patch and SlashEM source.
